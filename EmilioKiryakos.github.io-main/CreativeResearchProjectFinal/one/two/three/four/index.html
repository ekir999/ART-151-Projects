    <p class="pagetext1">During the 1990's, hip-hop started to transition to being mainstream and having a wider audience. This period of rap is when crew battles between the East and West coasts against each other to prove their coast was better. A big moment was when 2Pac and Biggie went at it against each other for their coast, people today still debate whether or not one of the two were better than each other to this day.</p>
    <p class="pagetext2">Some notable artists during 1990's hip-hop period were 2Pac, Notorious B.I.G, Snoop Dogg, Mobb Deep, Three 6 Mafia and OutKast.</p>
