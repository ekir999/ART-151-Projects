    <h class="headertext">The Research Question: Why I made this project</h>  
    <p class="pagetext1">The research question that I had in mind was about how was music able to be improved upon and how did society adapt and create new forms and types of music from exisitng ones. I attempted to understand this reason by looking back in time to specifically the rap/hip-hop genre because its timeline changes drastically culturally and the music sound aswell. I tried to summarize each decade of the music genre so that the viewer can grasp what society was like during those periods of time and read a bit about it.</p>
