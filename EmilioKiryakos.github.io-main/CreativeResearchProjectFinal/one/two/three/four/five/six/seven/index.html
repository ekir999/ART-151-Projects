    <h class="headertext">Present-Day Rap/Hip-Hop and my opinion of the future for the genre: </h>  
    <p class="pagetext1">My opinion currently about the rap/hip-hop genre so far is that it seems to be a decent state from more independent artists in the game, more subgenres tried out and artists starting to use digital media and platforms to showcase their songs such as Soundcloud and Spotify.</p>
    <p class="pagetext2">For the future of the music genre, I think that there might be a projection where the digital mediums provding music to the masses starts to become more reliant on subscription based payment models, more technological features and inventions created to carry music in a more portable fashion.</p>
